# Some Reviews from Students enrolled in this Course

`I am not novice when it comes to bash but I find course very useful. There are multiple ways of doing things in bash, I get
 that but for beginners those things should be explained better.
 . . . . . . . . . . . As I said I am not novice, I still learned few things. I think this is one of the best bash scripting tutorials on the net.`                                                       - Goran Veletic, 4 months ago *

  `Amazing! For the person that has no experience in scripting and programming, this course will give you the foundation
   needed to learn linux bash. Best course I have taken on Udemy! p.s. I never write reviews but this course was too good
   to not post.`                                                             - Aretha Vees, 6 months ago *
